<h2>My name is Russ Vetsper
</h2>



<h3>I have always been fascinated about web developing, that fascination brought me to epicodus where i learned a lot about coding. I believe in success through hard work & dedication. My motto in life is ‘If you want something, work hard & you will achieve it;  i learned in life that there are no short cuts . 
    I enjoy problem solving, the feeling you get when you struggle on something and that moment when everything comes together is a feeling that is very hard to describe.</h3>
